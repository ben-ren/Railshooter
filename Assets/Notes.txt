To-Do
=====
> Custom Unity Railway construction tool (places rail objects constructed on bezier curves.)
> Allow for collection of rail object segments.
> To enable this rails must be placed in segments
> Setup tile snapping to ensure rails connect properly. 
> Is this viable with the tilemap or will a custom grid be required?

Steps
=====
1. Calculate node grid
2. Check if straight line
3. If straight place segment
4. If curved Create Bezier curve
5. Calculate 2 offsets (E.g. +5 & -5), this is for the 2 rails
6. Subdivide curve into curve segments
7. place boards to indicate segments
8. Store data into node grid.
